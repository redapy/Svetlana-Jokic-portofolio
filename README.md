# Svetlana-Jokic-portofolio

- This app is a react website that showcases the potential skills of an ESL(English as a Second Language) teacher.
- This app uses the react-router library to switch between pages, which makes switching much faster and smoother than requesting, every page, from the server.
- Uses styled-components to style different components.
- Animated with framer-motion.

#### Improvements I'd like to add

- Add an about page that holds more information about the teacher.
- Add a controlled form, to contact the teacher, inside the about page.

## Installation

- First, use `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- then start the development server `npm start`.
- for more information please refer to [react-app](/react-app.md)

## Try it !!
